      <h2>Bidder Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        To participate in any DGW auction, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and have a valid
        payment method on file. By registering and placing a bid, you represent and warrant that you meet
        these requirements and that all information you have provided is accurate and complete.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
        activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify DGW immediately of any unauthorized
        use of your account. DGW reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account at its sole
        discretion, including accounts that show signs of shill bidding, non-payment history, or other
        violations of our Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Bidding Rules</h2>
      <p>
        All bids are binding and irrevocable. Once placed, a bid cannot be retracted except at DGW&apos;s
        sole discretion in extraordinary circumstances. Bids are processed in the order received, and in
        the event of identical maximum bids, the earlier bid takes priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        DGW employs a proxy bidding system. When you enter a maximum bid, the system will bid on your
        behalf using the minimum increments necessary to maintain your position as the high bidder, up
        to your maximum amount. You are responsible for all bids placed by the proxy system on your behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prevent auction sniping, DGW uses a soft-close system. If a bid is placed within the final
        minutes of a lot&apos;s closing time, the closing time will automatically extend to allow other
        bidders a fair opportunity to respond.
      </p>

      <h2>Reserve Prices</h2>
      <p>
        Some lots may have a reserve price, which is the minimum price the consignor will accept. If
        bidding does not meet the reserve, the lot will not be sold. Reserve prices are confidential
        and will not be disclosed. Lots that have met their reserve will be indicated on the auction
        platform where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Payment is due in full within twenty-four (24) hours of auction close. Your default payment
        method on file will be charged automatically for the total purchase price, which includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hammer price (your winning bid)</li>
        <li>Buyer&apos;s premium (percentage stated in auction listing)</li>
        <li>Applicable state and local sales tax</li>
        <li>Shipping and handling costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you wish to make alternate payment arrangements, you must contact us in writing at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:dgwcollectibles@gmail.com">dgwcollectibles@gmail.com</a> within twenty-four
        (24) hours of receiving your invoice.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        DGW ships all lots fully insured to addresses within the United States. International shipping
        is available for an additional fee. All purchased lots will be shipped within seven (7) business
        days of confirmed payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please confirm your shipping address within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving your winning
        invoice by emailing <a href="mailto:dgwcollectibles@gmail.com">dgwcollectibles@gmail.com</a>.
        If no contact is made, the shipping address on file will be used automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        DGW Collectibles, Inc. is not responsible for any damage, loss, or delay occurring once items
        have been transferred to the shipping carrier. All shipping claims must be made directly with
        the carrier. DGW will provide tracking information for all shipments.
      </p>

      <h2>Buyer&apos;s Premium</h2>
      <p>
        A buyer&apos;s premium will be added to the hammer price of each lot won. The applicable buyer&apos;s
        premium percentage is stated prominently on each auction listing and in the auction terms.
        The buyer&apos;s premium is non-negotiable and applies to all lots regardless of final price.
      </p>

      <h2>Invoicing</h2>
      <p>
        Following the close of each auction, DGW will generate invoices for all winning bidders. Invoices
        will be sent to the email address associated with your account. If you are the winning bidder on
        multiple lots within the same auction, your purchases will be combined into a single invoice.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Failure to pay in full within the required timeframe may result in cancellation of your purchase,
        a 20% restocking fee, suspension of bidding privileges, pursuit of the full amount owed including
        collection costs, and/or reporting to credit agencies. Repeated non-payment will result in
        permanent account termination.
      </p>

      <h2>Authenticity Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        Where an item is explicitly described as &quot;authentic,&quot; &quot;genuine,&quot; or &quot;original,&quot; DGW stands behind
        that representation. If such an item is later proven by a qualified and widely recognized
        authentication authority (e.g., PSA, PCGS, GIA) to be counterfeit, DGW will issue a full
        refund of the hammer price and buyer&apos;s premium upon receipt and verification of the item in
        its original, unaltered condition within sixty (60) days of the Buyer&apos;s receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guarantee does not cover differences of opinion in grading, condition assessments,
        estimated values, or any other subjective determination.
      </p>
