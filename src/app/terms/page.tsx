        By registering for, participating in, or placing any bid in an auction conducted by DGW Collectibles, Inc.
        d/b/a DGW Collectibles & Estates (&quot;DGW,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;), you (&quot;Bidder,&quot; &quot;Buyer,&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) acknowledge
        that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following Terms & Conditions of Sale.
        These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and DGW.
      </p>

      <h2>1. All Lots Sold As-Is, Where-Is</h2>
      <p>
        All property is sold AS IS, WHERE IS, and WITH ALL FAULTS. There are no returns, refunds, exchanges,
        or credits under any circumstances once bidding has concluded, except in the limited case where an item
        explicitly described as &quot;authentic,&quot; &quot;genuine,&quot; or &quot;original&quot; is later proven by a qualified and widely
        recognized authentication authority (e.g., PSA, PCGS, GIA, or equivalent industry body) to be a counterfeit.
        In such rare instances, DGW will issue a refund for the hammer price and buyer&apos;s premium upon receipt and
        verification of the disputed item in its original, unaltered condition within sixty (60) days of the
        Buyer&apos;s receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bidders acknowledge and agree that all other sales are final, and no claim will be made for any reason,
        including but not limited to condition, description, provenance, authenticity of grading opinions, or
        appraised/market value.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Buyer Due Diligence</h2>
      <p>
        Condition reports are not guaranteed to be comprehensive and may not be provided for every lot. The absence
        of a condition report does not imply the lot is free of defects. All descriptions, weights, and measurements
        are approximate and provided for informational purposes only. It is the sole responsibility of each Bidder
        to examine, research, and evaluate any lot prior to bidding. Bidders are encouraged to consult their own
        experts or appraisers before placing bids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your act of bidding signifies that you have viewed all available photographs, read the description, and
        conducted your own due diligence.
      </p>

      <h2>3. No Warranty or Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        DGW Collectibles, Inc. and/or its agents make no express or implied warranties or representations of any kind,
        including but not limited to any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, age, condition,
        material, or authenticity. All written and oral statements, descriptions, and catalog text are DGW&apos;s opinions
        only and shall not be construed as statements of fact. By bidding, you expressly waive any claim arising out
        of differences in opinion between third-party appraisers or market fluctuations.
      </p>
      <div className="callout">
        <p>
          <strong>BY BIDDING IN THIS AUCTION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RECEIVING THE EXACT PHOTOGRAPHED LOT(S),
          REGARDLESS OF CATALOG DESCRIPTION.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>4. Market Value & Bidding Acknowledgment</h2>
      <p>
        All Bidders acknowledge that auction prices are determined solely by competitive bidding (as all lots open
        at $0) and do not necessarily reflect fair market value, retail replacement value, or appraised value. By
        participating, Bidders affirm that they have independently assessed each item&apos;s desirability and potential
        value and agree not to dispute or seek a refund on the basis of overpayment, perceived overvaluation, or
        subsequent appraisal discrepancies.
      </p>
      <p>
        No returns or reversals will be accepted due to a Bidder&apos;s change of opinion, resale results, third-party
        evaluation, or claims that the final hammer price exceeded market value.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Automatic & Proxy Bidding</h2>
      <p>
        Bidders utilizing any automatic bidding, proxy bidding, or maximum bid feature offered by the auction platform
        accept full responsibility for all bids placed on their behalf. Technical issues with the auction platform,
        internet connectivity, or the Bidder&apos;s device do not constitute grounds for bid cancellation or reversal.
        By using automated bidding features, you confirm that you intend to be bound by the results of such bidding.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Buyer&apos;s Premium</h2>
      <p>
        A buyer&apos;s premium of the percentage stated in the auction listing will be added to the hammer price of each lot.
        The buyer&apos;s premium is clearly displayed on the auction platform prior to bidding. By placing a bid, you agree to
        pay the total purchase price, which consists of the hammer price plus the applicable buyer&apos;s premium, plus any
        applicable taxes.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        Payment is due in full within twenty-four (24) hours of sale close. The credit card on file will be automatically
        charged for both the purchase total and shipping, unless alternate arrangements have been confirmed in writing
        within twenty-four (24) hours of invoicing.
      </p>
      <p>Failure to remit payment in full within this timeframe may result in, at DGW&apos;s sole discretion:</p>
      <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'lower-alpha' }}>
        <li>Cancellation of the Bidder&apos;s purchase and revocation of bidding privileges;</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>8. Sales Tax</h2>
      <p>
        All purchases are subject to applicable state and local sales tax as required by law. Sales tax will be calculated
        and applied based on the Buyer&apos;s shipping address and will be added to the invoice total. Tax-exempt Buyers must
        provide a valid exemption certificate prior to sale close.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Shipping & Insurance</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        In no event shall DGW Collectibles, Inc., its officers, directors, employees, agents, or affiliates be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to any
        auction transaction. DGW&apos;s total aggregate liability under these Terms shall not exceed the hammer price plus
        buyer&apos;s premium actually paid by the Buyer for the specific lot giving rise to the claim. Nothing in this
        Section shall be construed to limit DGW&apos;s liability for fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to initiating any legal action or proceeding, the Buyer agrees to provide written notice to DGW describing
        the nature of the dispute and the relief sought. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute
        informally for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such notice. If the dispute cannot be resolved
        informally within this period, either party may proceed with legal action in accordance with the Governing Law
        provision below.

      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions constitute a binding agreement between the Bidder and DGW Collectibles, Inc. and shall
        be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict
        of laws principles. By placing a bid, all Bidders irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
        of Dutchess County, New York, and agree that no claim or dispute shall be brought elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms & Conditions is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, such finding shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of any remaining
        provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Amendments</h2>
      <p>
        DGW reserves the right to amend these Terms & Conditions at any time. Any amendments will be posted on the
        auction platform prior to or at the commencement of the applicable auction. Continued participation in any
        auction after such posting constitutes acceptance of the amended terms.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions, together with any auction-specific announcements or addenda made by DGW prior to or
        during the auction, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
        and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written.
